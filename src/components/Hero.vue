                    I love to code, nothing is more satisfying then deleting a hundred lines of code and replacing it with three.
                    I enjoy learning new tools, frameworks and languages as well. Thomas and Hunts Pragmatic Programmer and Robert Martin's Clean Code, changed how I think about and write software.
                    I strongly believe in practical and easy to under stand solutions to problems. But most of all I enjoy writing good quality clean code.
